# A tool for creating Gentoo virtual appliances

I started this project in 2010 as Gentoo's answer to Ubuntu's
[vmbuilder](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/en/man1/vmbuilder.1.html).
Alas, I no longer use this tool, but for a while it was a labor of love. I
have since jumped on the container bandwagon and build most of my Gentoo
containers using my other tool, [Gentoo Build
Publisher](https://github.com/enku/gentoo-build-publisher).
